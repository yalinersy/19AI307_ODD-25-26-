# Ex.No:1(C) LOOPING STATEMENT

## QUESTION:
Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop. The factorial of n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

## AIM:
To write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop. 

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.


2. Import the java.util.Scanner package.


3. Read an integer n from the user.


4. Initialize factorial to 1.


5. Use a loop from 1 to n, multiplying each value with factorial.


6. Print the final factorial value and end the program.







## PROGRAM:
 ```

Program to implement a Looping Statement using Java
Developed by: Sri Yaline R
RegisterNumber: 212224040325

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scanner.nextInt(); 
        long factorial = 1; 
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}

```

## SOURCE CODE:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scanner.nextInt(); 
        long factorial = 1; 
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}

```
